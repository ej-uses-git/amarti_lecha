To initialize the server, ensure that you have the following environment variables:

- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
- TWILIO_AUTH_KEY
- TWILIO_NUMBER
- TWILIO_JOIN_MESSAGE (optional)

Then run `npm start`.

Whenever you update a file and want the server to activate it, run `npm run build` in a different terminal window and the server will automatically restart.
